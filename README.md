###H3 **PROJECT TITLE**

Hi everyone!

My name is Phoenix Doan and I am a third year studying Business Analytis Information Systems at the University of Iowa. I also have a certificate in event management. I am currently seeking an internship for the summer of 2022. A fun fact about me is that I am a proud first generation student!

During my free time I like to cook new foods from different cusines. I specficially like to learn to make Vietnamese food as it was my childhood favorite dishes. I also spend my time being outdoors and in nature. I love the summer time for the longer and sunnier days.
